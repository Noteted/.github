<h2> ðŸ¤” | What is <b>Noteted</b>? </h2>
<p>
    <b>Noteted</b> is a note taking app inspired by many other popular note taking app like <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a>, <a href="https://about.noteshub.app/">Noteshub</a> and <a href="https://joplinapp.org/">Joplin</a>! <br>
    This app will stay free forever because people don't like paid apps. <br>
    <b>Noteted</b> is also open-source, and is based on the programming language, python! <br>
    It's also just a hobby project since Dave likes making random stuff :)

<h2> ðŸ’» | Who is the founder/creator of <b>Noteted</b>? </h2>
<p>
    <b>Daveberry Blueson</b>! <br>
    He used to be known for <a href="https://github.com/Team-UniverseEngine/Universe-Engine"><b>Universe Engine</b></a> and other stuff. But since then, he quit developing for those and decided to make something he wanted something to make from the ground up. <br>
<p>

<h2> ðŸ’­ | How long will this project <b>maintain</b>? </h2>
<p>
    Honestly, it depends. <br>
    So far, we don't know yet.
